HR Analytics Projects :
This project showcases interactive HR Analytics Dashboards built to analyze employee attrition, income trends, work-life balance,job satisfaction rate and more. The dashboards visualize KPIs such as:

1.Attrition Rate by Department
2.Average Monthly Income by Job Role
3.Education Background of Active Employees
4.Work-Life Balance and job satisfaction Ratings
5.Gender, Marital Status & Age Distribution
6.Average working years by Department

These visualizations were created using Power BI and Excel and also used SQL offering insights to support data-driven HR decisions.

Tools Used:
1. Power BI – For interactive dashboard creation and KPI visualization
2. MS Excel – For static dashboard design, charting, and analysis
3. SQL – For data extraction, filtering, and preparing datasets used in dashboards
4. Power Query – For data cleaning and transformation in Power BI & Excel
5. Excel Formulas – Used for calculations and conditional formatting in Excel dashboards

Insights:
1. Attrition Rate is high at 50.21%, with Research (51.21%) and Sales showing the highest attrition.
2. Managers earn the highest monthly income (~₹26,400), while HR and Research roles earn less.
3. Work-life balance is best in Research Director and Manufacturing Director roles.
4. Most active employees have backgrounds in Medical and Life Sciences (~17% each).
5. Job satisfaction varies; Sales and Lab Technician roles show lower satisfaction.
6. Income doesn't directly reduce attrition—non-monetary factors also affect employee retention.
